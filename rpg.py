# I wanted to learn more Python class structures. What better way to do that than creating a dungeon crawler in 32 lines or less.
# How to play. The first level you will die if you don't heal yourself, so make sure you do that. Once level two you can hold down Enter til you get to level 10 and beat the game.
# There are lots of opportunities to take this code and make add RNG, loot, this or that. Maybe one day I'll come back to that but not today.

At the very end of the chair is a skeleton with a head on it.","action":"inspect the skeleton","action_description":"You touch the skeleton and it suddenly collapses into dust. You hear a screech coming from above and before you lands a monster."},"2":{"name":"Hallway","description":"It's a hallway. It has paintings along the way and a few doors you can check out.","action":"inspect the painting","action_description":"You investigate one of the paintings.

You're not sure how you got here, but you did. There's a box sitting alone by itself.","action":"open the box","action_description":"You open the box. The box is empty.

It's interesting to wonder how you wound up here, but now you are here. There's a water fountain in the couryard.","action":"check out the water fountain","action_description":"You walk over to the water fountain and inspect it. It looks like an ordinary water fountain. You look down and find a note. You pick it up and read it. It says 'Healthcare is too important to stay the same'. You're not sure why this was left here.
